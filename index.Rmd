### Undergraduate student | R Enthusiast

My name is Stelios and I live in Athens, Greece. Currently, I am an undergraduate student of [Statistics and Insurance Science](https://www.unipi.gr/unipi/en/sta-home-en.html) (exp. graduate Sept, 2024). R is my go-to tool for my data-analysis tasks. I have some hands-on experience, by writing notebooks and developing some simple Shiny apps. I would like to further enhance my knowledge - skills, concerning R, in a working environment.

An analysis based on Kaggle's recent survey (2022). My analysis focuses primarily on Greek users. Comparing them with the rest users of Kaggle, I came up with interesting facts as.

### Search for Possible Clients  `r fa(name = "r-project", fill = "steelblue")`

N/A

N/A

Developing a machine learning model (LightGBM, XGBoost) in order to classify clients based on their interest to create a term deposit account (Yes / No). The best performant model has a satisfactory accuracy (88.9 \%) . On this case-scenario the company will not have to call all their clients (1132) but they can focus only on the predicted ones (75). The use of the model decreases 93% the working hours.


### API Project  <img src="images/pylogo.png" alt="drawing" height="13"/>

[DockerHub](https://stesiam.shinyapps.io/Ship-Passengers/) | [GitHub Repo](https://stesiam.shinyapps.io/Ship-Passengers/)

N/A

N/A

Using 4 years of historical data, I have developed a model to predict tomorrow's ship passengers and cars. The app uses the Rhino framework, which is the newest approach to make Shiny Apps. For UI purposes I have used **HTML** (Shiny tags) and **SASS**. Furthermore, the app uses API in order to get the data from data.gov.gr and tools to retrieve those automatically (CI/CD).

current - 2016


During my studies, I was taught several statistics-related courses and had some exposure to statistical programs. Indicatively, Probabilities, Statistics: Estimation Theory, Non-parametric Statistics, Sampling and Statistical Programs using R are some of the most influential courses that helped me develop my knowledge regarding Statistics.
