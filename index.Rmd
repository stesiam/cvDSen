### Undergraduate student | R Enthusiast

My name is Stelios and I live in Athens, Greece. Currently, I am an undergraduate student of [Statistics and Insurance science](https://www.unipi.gr/unipi/en/sta-home-en.html) (exp. graduate Sept, 2023). R is my go-to tool for my data-analysis tasks. I have some hands-on experience, by writing notebooks and developing some simple Shiny apps. I would like to further enhance my knowledge - skills, concerning R, in a working environment.

An analysis based on Kaggle's recent survey (2022). My analysis focuses primarily on Greek users. Comparing them with the rest users of Kaggle, I came up with interesting facts as. 


### Search for Possible Clients

N/A

N/A

Developing a machine learning model (LightGBM, XGBoost) in order to classify clients based on their interest to create a term deposit account (Yes / No). The best performant model has a satisfactory accuracy (88.9 \%) . On this case-scenario the company will not have to call all their clients (1132) but they can focus only on the predicted ones (75). The use of the model decreases 93% the working hours.


### Ship Travellers

[Shiny App](https://stesiam.shinyapps.io/Ship-Passengers/)

N/A

N/A

Using 4 years of historical data, I have developed a model to predict tomorrow's ship passengers and cars. The app uses the Rhino framework, which is the newest approach to make Shiny Apps. For UI purposes I have used **HTML** (Shiny tags) and **SASS**. Furthermore, the app uses API in order to get the data from data.gov.gr and tools to retrieve those automatically (CI/CD). 


### Greek Elections Shiny App

[Link](https://stesiam.shinyapps.io/GreekElectionsShiny/)

N/A

N/A

A Shiny App that calculates MP seats in Greek Parliament. Concerning frontend, I have developed it with HTML and CSS. Shiny library was the tool to add backend functionality to my app. Furthermore, to make development more productive I have used Git and Docker. Unit testing of custom functions is being developed.
