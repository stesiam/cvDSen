# 🧔🏻 Oh, you have just found my CV! 📝

My Data Science (DS)-centric CV in English. In short, I enumerate my skills and some of my projects using R, given the fact that I have not worked in DS field yet. It is based on [nstrayer's CV](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv), 
although I do not use any other package in order to automate any information shown on it(e.g. googlesheets4, datadrivencv). Of course I have set my own preferences and style on it. 🙂

Regarding the QR code, it was initially generated by Bitly. Later, I discovered that Inksscape can also generate a QR code quite easily.
Now, I can have my precious QR code in SVG format, which is important for adopting the color of the background in contrast to other image formats, without worrying about the limitations of Bitly's free plan.

This CV is made with the help of:

- Rmarkdown {[pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown)}
- A little bit of **CSS**
- {[fontawesome](https://github.com/rstudio/fontawesome)}
